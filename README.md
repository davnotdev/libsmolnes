# libsmolnes

`libsmolnes` is a slight modification of [`smolnes`](https://github.com/binji/smolnes)
to decouple it from SDL, allowing you to embed an impressively simple and tiny NES emulator into whatever you want.
`smolnes` doesn't contain sound or any ROM validation, just video and input. 

Disclaimer, I DID NOT CREATE [`smolnes`](https://github.com/binji/smolnes).
[`smolnes`](https://github.com/binji/smolnes) is a really cool NES emulator created by Ben Smith.
Please check go check it out.

## Usage

```
make
make sdl_example
make clean
```

Have fun!
